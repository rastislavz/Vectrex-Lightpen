# The build process

The building of this lightpen is a bit tedious process since it uses the refillable whiteboard marker instead some genuine build body.
The first step is to disembowel the marker guts: after the back is screwed open and the ink cartridge is taken out, the rest of the guts can be simply pulled out with the long nose pliers.
